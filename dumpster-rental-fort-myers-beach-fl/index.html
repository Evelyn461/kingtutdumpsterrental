                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:medium;">What size of dumpster will be suitable for my restaurant?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">For commercial businesses that generate waste regularly, we offer various dumpster sizes to fit your needs. Our front-load or rear-load dumpsters are often the best fit for restaurants. The ideal size depends on how much waste your restaurant produces, and our team is always ready to help you assess that and recommend the right option.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Can I dispose of heavy materials into your dumpster?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Yes, you can do so. They are built durably with reinforced metal. But do note the weight limit of the dumpster you rent.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How can I make payment for a dumpster rental service?
                </h4>

                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">While we do not purchase scrap metal directly, we can provide a dedicated roll off container for it. Depending on the volume and current market rates for metal, we can often offer a significantly reduced hauling fee or, in some cases, a no-cost haul for clean-loaded, high-value scrap. Please call us to discuss your specific material.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How long can I rent roll-off dumpsters?
